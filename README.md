# TC2E.3-118 (30Hz tuning)
TC2E.3-118 Paraflex subwoofer was originaly designed by Matthew Morgan J. member of the **Higher Order Quarterwave Society** (HOQWS) which was started in 2013 by Matthew Morgan J, Dustin Morgan (Flex Tech Designs) and J. Vansickle (Paragon Concepts) 

# About Paraflex
The subwoofer is based on a low and high tuned resonator making the design very efficient in it's bandwidth, which was named **Paraflex** for easy naming. Many prototypes and design revisions have been made by members of the HOQWS, continualy improving the design of the cabinet and its different versions.

This is the 30hz tuned (Fb) version of the Paraflex C2E-118. This layout has the same outer dimensions as the higher tuned Type C2E-118 subwoofers

# Working range
The subwoofer has a 30Hz (Fb) tuning and has a working range shall be 25hz to 90hz. Recomended crossover setting depends on the driver used, but a basic setting can be set with a 25hz 4th order Butterworth Highpass filter (24dB/BW HPF) and a 75-90hz Butterworth 4th order low pass filter (75-90hz 24dB/BW LPF). We encourage the user to adjust the frequency range and filter based on their application. 

Other designs using the Paraflex principles where made for midrange and infrasonic frequency ranges. There are always new concepts and designs in progress on the [HOQWS facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/groups/bassaz/).
